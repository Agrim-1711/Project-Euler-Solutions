# Project-Euler-Solutions

# These are my attempts to solving Project Euler problems using Python coding
# Project Euler problems can be found here:https://projecteuler.net/archives
# I enjoy solving these problems as it helps me to build on problem-solving skills by using Python code that yields a correct solution to an interesting Mathematics problem that requires logic and lateral thinking as well as mathematical and computer science knowledge.
# For me, the real satisfaction of these problems lies not only in solving them correctly, but producing the Python code efficiently and later optimising it to reduce the time taken to obtain the answers.
